## Technologies Used
- SQLite - version 1.0
- Weka (machine learning algorithms) - version 2.0
- android Room - version 3.0


## Features
List the ready features here:
- shows real time activity tracking on Google Map
- detects your exercise type automatically by reading sensors of your phone. (Weka machine learning feature)
- let you see the history of your exercises
